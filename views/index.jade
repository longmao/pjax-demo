  pjax loads html from your server into the current page
  | without a full page load. It's ajax with real permalinks,
  | page titles, and a working back button that fully degrades.

p
  Check the box to toggle pjax.

p
  Whenever the time changes, a full page load has happened.
  | If the time doesn't change,  no full page load has occurred.

p
  The idea is you can't tell the difference between pjax
  | page loads and normal page loads. On complicated sites,
  | browsing just "feels faster."
